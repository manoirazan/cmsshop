README:


The CMS Shop test suite is setup to run tests on a demo shop website at https://cms.demo.katalon.com/

The project require Visual Studio 19 and above.
To run the single test simply build the project and from the Test Explorer pane select the single test and click run. 

The test currently has some minor bugs and it can be further improved in terms of adding verifications where needed instead of using sleep.
